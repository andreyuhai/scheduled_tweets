# Scheduled Tweets

This is a Rails app created by following [Rails for Beginners](https://gorails.com/series/rails-for-beginners) course by
Chris Oliver. What the app does is obvious. You can,

- Create an account
- Connect your Twitter account
- Schedule Tweets to be tweeted at a specific date and time
